#   description:  The default value used for sanity checks to validate the

#                 The specified value is taken as the maximum in kW, and 
#                 the minimum value is derived by multiplying by -1 (e.g. 
#                 if the option value is 100, the minimum value will be
#                 -100). The value is applied per second, so the actual
#                 sanity check applied to a sensor is a multiple of the
#                 scan-interval. For energy sensors, the check is applied
